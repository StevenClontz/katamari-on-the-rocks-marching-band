# Katamari on the Rocks for Marching Band

An arrangement by myself (Steven Clontz, alias Steben on the Overclocked ReMix
forums) of the Katamari Damacy theme, Katamari on the Rocks, for marching band.
Percussion arrangement by Christopher Nelson (alias Rainman DX on the
Overclocked ReMix forums). The arrangement was written somewhere around 2006,
when I was a student at Auburn University (hence why I stuck a bit of
"War Eagle" in the arrangement).

Over the last decade I'd get requests for the arrangement
every couple years or so, but somewhere down the road I had misplaced the
hard drive that contained them. Fortunately, I recently
had the presence of mind to track down Chris, who had kept up with his
copies better than I.

The arrangement's Finale source files and a burned MP3 of the resulting
MIDI have been stored in this repo for posterity.
